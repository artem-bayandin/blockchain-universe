# Hello stranger,

My name is Artem and I'm building an NFT universe. This will contain a list of projects, initially not related, but possibly acquiring such relations after being released. Below you may find the list with minor description. There will be more description, more links, and more details about each project after one being released. The main purpose of current document is to highlight the list of my personal pet projects in blockchain domain, so that my business partners has complain less about 'stealing' code in the future.

*<sub>Links might not open, as repos might be private and/or not yet exist. I will do my best to create repos and add descriptions asap. But this does not mean, that repos will be public.</sub>*

# Prologue

Before we go the list of projects, let me introduce you some 'utils' projects I'm working on.

## 01. [nft-sandbox](https://github.com/artem-bayandin/nft-sandbox)

This is my playground, where I test and collect different interesting strategies connected to blockchain. Includes several sub-projects, some might be used as boilerplates for my future projects, but give you 98% probability that projects inside this repo may not build, event being pushed to `master` branch - it takes time to clean everything up, so sometimes it might be ok to understand the principle and then implement it in a real project. But believe me, I'll do my best to leave these projects in a buildable state.

## 02. [blockchain-utils](https://github.com/artem-bayandin/blockchain-utils)

This project contains different helpers that might be useful across projects. For example, it may contain permission managers, iterable mappings, and so on.

## 03. [blockchain-samples](https://github.com/artem-bayandin/blockchain-samples)

Some commonly used samples of contracts, like 'multi-sig wallet', 'staking', and/or usage of 'iterable mapping', 'role manager' from the repo above.

# Projects

## 11. [NFT Collectible #1](https://github.com/artem-bayandin/blockchain-universe)

Aka 'standard' '10k random avatars'. 'Standard' list of attributes will apply (kinda 'mouth', 'hair', 'voice', etc).

## 12. [NFT Collectible #2](https://github.com/artem-bayandin/blockchain-universe)

Aka 'not-for-all' collectibles. Some selling restrictions, several rarity properties according to the shape of a product.

## 13. [NFT Collectible #3](https://github.com/artem-bayandin/blockchain-universe)

Some super-rare rediculously restricted NFT collectible.

## 14. [NFT Collectible #4](https://github.com/artem-bayandin/blockchain-universe)

Revolutionary way of building NFT.

## 15. [NFT Collectible with marketplace](https://github.com/artem-bayandin/blockchain-universe)

NFT collectible with generations and its own marketplace.

## 16. [NFT Messenger](https://github.com/artem-bayandin/blockchain-universe)

I think, it's clear from the name.

## 17. [NFT Browser PRG](https://github.com/artem-bayandin/blockchain-universe)

NFT-based Browser RPG. ERC721 for players, ERC1155 for assets, smart contract as a game contract.

## 18. [Staking machine](https://github.com/artem-bayandin/blockchain-satisfactor)

I think, it's clear from the name.

## 19. [Tamagochi](https://github.com/artem-bayandin/blockchain-universe)

NFT-based game. ERC721 for players, ERC1155 for assets, smart contract as a game contract. Possibe to have an ability to extend 'main' game contract with other 'side' contracts. Everybody knows what Tamagochi is - I will code it one day.

## 99. [NFT project 'of your choice'](https://github.com/artem-bayandin/blockchain-universe)

The community will vote for the next project to be build.
